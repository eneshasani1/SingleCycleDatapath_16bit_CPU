# Single Cycle Datapath 16 bit CPU
This project models a 16 bit CPU which uses only one datapath component per cycle(i.e. it executes an instruction per cycle), thus it is a single cycle datapath 16 bit CPU. It supports basic instructions like add, subtract, or, xor, load word, store word, ROR, SLLI etc. The complete list of the instruction it supports and the detailed explanation of its components and their interaction can be found in the pdf files "Raporti_Grupi14" and "Pershkrimi i problemit".
